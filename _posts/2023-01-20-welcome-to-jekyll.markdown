We are taking on lots of exciting projects in 2023!

* The team working on [Harmony](https://harmonydata.org) has just been approved by the Wellcome Trust to proceed to the prototype phase of the Wellcome Trust Mental Health Data Prize!
* We have a preprint [publication](https://osf.io/unj7p) of a technical paper about Harmony.
* We have a paper about the [Clinical Trial Risk Tool](https://clinicaltrialrisk.org/) also on the way!
* We are participating in a legal reasoning workshop.
* We are still working with [White Ribbon Alliance](https://whiteribbonalliance.org/) on [dashboards and text processing](https://fastdatascience.com/nlp-dashboard/).
* We've been collaborating on a YouTube video with [NiklasOPF](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5yHSsQrYNL663gk6p36GiQ), who does a series of videos on data science and business. Watch this space!
